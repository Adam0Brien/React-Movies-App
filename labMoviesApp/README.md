## Features


### Liking Movies

One of the key features of this app is the ability to like your favorite movies. You can easily mark movies as your favorites, and they will be saved for easy access in your "Favorite Movies" list.

### Watch Later

Another handy feature is the "Watch Later" functionality. If you come across a movie you want to watch but don't have time for right now, you can add it to your "Watch Later" list.
